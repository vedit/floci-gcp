# Cloud Storage (GCS)

floci-gcp emulates Google Cloud Storage using the real GCP wire protocols:

- **gRPC v2**, bucket and object management plus streaming reads and writes
- **REST XML**, object operations (upload, download, delete, list objects)
- **REST JSON**, bucket and object management, IAM, ACLs, notifications, HMAC keys, and uploads

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FLOCI_GCP_SERVICES_GCS_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable/disable Cloud Storage |
| `FLOCI_GCP_SERVICES_GCS_UPLOAD_SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `604800` | Idle time before an unfinished resumable or streaming upload session is dropped, matching the real GCS seven-day session window. Lower it on long-lived instances to reclaim buffered bytes sooner |
| `FLOCI_GCP_SERVICES_GCS_UPLOAD_SESSION_SWEEP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `3600` | How often abandoned upload sessions are swept; `0` disables the sweeper |
| `FLOCI_GCP_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:4588` | Base URL embedded in object URLs and pre-signed URLs |

## Emulator Variable

```bash
export STORAGE_EMULATOR_HOST=http://localhost:4588
export STORAGE_EMULATOR_HOST_GRPC=localhost:4588
```

REST clients use `STORAGE_EMULATOR_HOST`. The Go gRPC client uses
`STORAGE_EMULATOR_HOST_GRPC` without a URL scheme. Java gRPC clients configure
the endpoint through `StorageOptions.grpc()`.

## Service Account Authentication

Clients can exercise the normal service-account OAuth flow by setting the
credential's `token_uri` to the emulator:

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "floci-local",
  "private_key_id": "test-key",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "test@floci-local.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "123456789",
  "token_uri": "http://localhost:4588/token"
}
```

floci-gcp implements the standard OAuth JWT bearer exchange and returns a
short-lived Bearer token. As with other emulator credentials, JWT signatures
and Bearer tokens are not validated.

## Quick Start

=== "gcloud CLI"

    ```bash
    export STORAGE_EMULATOR_HOST=http://localhost:4588

    # Create a bucket
    gcloud storage buckets create gs://my-bucket

    # Upload an object
    echo "hello from floci-gcp" | gcloud storage cp - gs://my-bucket/hello.txt

    # List objects
    gcloud storage ls gs://my-bucket

    # Download
    gcloud storage cp gs://my-bucket/hello.txt -

    # Delete
    gcloud storage rm gs://my-bucket/hello.txt
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java

        .setCredentials(NoCredentials.getInstance())
        .build()
        .getService();

    // Create bucket
    Bucket bucket = storage.create(BucketInfo.of("my-bucket"));

    // Upload object
    Blob blob = storage.create(
        BlobInfo.newBuilder("my-bucket", "hello.txt").build(),
        "hello from floci-gcp".getBytes());

    // Download object
    byte[] content = storage.readAllBytes("my-bucket", "hello.txt");

    // List objects
    Page<Blob> blobs = storage.list("my-bucket");
    blobs.iterateAll().forEach(b -> System.out.println(b.getName()));

    # Create bucket
    bucket = client.bucket("my-bucket")
    client.create_bucket(bucket)

    # Upload object
    blob = bucket.blob("hello.txt")
    blob.upload_from_string("hello from floci-gcp")

    # Download object
    content = blob.download_as_text()

    blob.delete()
    ```

=== "Node.js"

    ```javascript
    import { Storage } from "@google-cloud/storage";

    const storage = new Storage({
      apiEndpoint: "http://localhost:4588",
      projectId: "floci-local",
    });

    // Create bucket
    await storage.createBucket("my-bucket");

    // Upload object
    await storage.bucket("my-bucket").file("hello.txt")
        .save("hello from floci-gcp");

    // Download
    const [content] = await storage.bucket("my-bucket").file("hello.txt").download();

    // List objects
    const [files] = await storage.bucket("my-bucket").getFiles();
    files.forEach(f => console.log(f.name));
    ```

## Multipart Upload

floci-gcp supports multipart (resumable) upload, the standard GCS mechanism for large objects. The GCP SDK uses this automatically for objects above a threshold.

## Resumable Upload Sessions

`POST /upload/storage/v1/b/{bucket}/o?uploadType=resumable` opens a session and returns
the session URL in the `Location` header. Chunks go to that URL with a `Content-Range`
header, using either `PUT` or `POST`, the Java, Node and Python SDKs send `PUT`, the Go
SDK sends `POST`, and both are handled the same way.

Session behavior matches GCS:

| Request to the session URL | Response |
|---|---|
| Chunk that leaves bytes missing | `308` with `Range: bytes=0-<last received byte>` |
| Chunk that completes the object | `200` with the object metadata |
| Status query (`Content-Range: bytes */<total>` or `bytes */*`) | `308` with the received range, or `200` with the object metadata once complete |
| Chunk already received in full | `308` with the unchanged received range, without appending it again |
| Chunk starting past the received bytes | `503` with a `text/plain` body, matching GCS |
| Any request after completion | `200` with the stored object metadata |
| Unknown or expired `upload_id` | `404` |

The offset gap is the one session error GCS does not serve as JSON. Its body is the bare
message as `text/plain`, and the Java SDK sniffs that content type to tell a client-side
data loss apart from a transient `503`, failing fast rather than retrying. floci-gcp
reproduces the response byte for byte, down to the double space after `Invalid request.`:

```
HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
content-length: 138

Invalid request.  According to the Content-Range header, the upload offset is 4 byte(s), which exceeds already uploaded size of 0 byte(s).
```

The Go SDK sends `X-GUploader-No-308: yes` because `308` collides with the RFC 7238
"Permanent Redirect" semantics. floci-gcp answers those requests the way GCS does: `200`
with `X-HTTP-Status-Code-Override: 308` and the same `Range` header. Other status codes
are unaffected by the header.

Documented deviations from real GCS:

- GCS requires every non-final chunk to be a multiple of 256 KiB; floci-gcp accepts any
  chunk size.
- GCS answers a chunk `POST` that carries no `uploadType` with `405`; floci-gcp accepts
  it, since the `upload_id` alone identifies the session.
- Completed sessions are remembered for the most recent 1024 uploads rather than for a
  week.

## Object Versioning

Enable versioning on a bucket:

```java
storage.update(BucketInfo.newBuilder("my-bucket")
    .setVersioningEnabled(true)
    .build());
```

Each overwrite creates a new object generation. List all versions:

```java
Page<Blob> versions = storage.list("my-bucket",
    Storage.BlobListOption.versions(true));
```

## Pre-signed URLs

Generate a pre-signed URL for temporary public access:

```java
URL signedUrl = storage.signUrl(
    BlobInfo.newBuilder("my-bucket", "hello.txt").build(),
    15, TimeUnit.MINUTES,
    Storage.SignUrlOption.withV4Signature());
```

Pre-signed URLs are generated using the `FLOCI_GCP_BASE_URL` as the base.

## Virtual-Hosted Style URLs

floci-gcp supports virtual-hosted style GCS URLs:

```
http://my-bucket.localhost.floci.io:4588/hello.txt
```

The embedded DNS server resolves `*.localhost.floci.io` to floci-gcp's container IP when running inside Docker, so virtual-hosted URLs work from sidecar containers without extra DNS configuration.

## Supported Operations

**Cloud Storage gRPC v2:**

- Buckets: `CreateBucket`, `GetBucket`, `ListBuckets`, `UpdateBucket`, `DeleteBucket`
- Objects: `ComposeObject`, `GetObject`, `ListObjects`, `UpdateObject`, `DeleteObject`;
  object system metadata (`cacheControl`, `contentDisposition`, `contentEncoding`,
  `contentLanguage`, `customTime`, `storageClass`) round-trips with the REST path
- Data path: `ReadObject`, `WriteObject`, `BidiWriteObject`
- Resumable writes: `StartResumableWrite`, `QueryWriteStatus`

Bucket responses use `projects/{projectNumber}`, matching the REST bucket's
`projectNumber`. Project IDs remain the storage isolation key; the emulator
currently assigns the synthetic project number `1` to buckets. This value is
shared by all projects and is not a resolvable project alias. Continue using the
original project ID for create and list requests; replaying `projects/1` from a
bucket response does not resolve back to that project. Numeric project input
resolution is an existing emulator limitation, not full Storage v2 compatibility.
Supporting it requires unique persistent project identities and a policy for
existing buckets with the shared synthetic number.

The v2 MVP does not implement IAM policy RPCs, retention locking, rewrite,
move, restore, resumable cancellation, bidi reads, appendable objects, write
handles, or redirection. Unsupported RPCs return gRPC `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

**Bucket management (REST JSON):**

- `CreateBucket` (names validated against the GCS naming rules; a duplicate reports
  `reason: conflict`) (with `location`, `storageClass`, `versioning`, `lifecycle`, `cors`, `retentionPolicy`)
- `GetBucket`
- `ListBuckets` (with `pageToken` pagination)
- `UpdateBucket` / `PatchBucket`
- `DeleteBucket`
- `GetBucketIamPolicy` / `SetBucketIamPolicy`
- `TestBucketIamPermissions`, `GET /b/{bucket}/iam/testPermissions?permissions=...` (the GCS
  spelling); the Cloud IAM style `POST /b/{bucket}/iam:testPermissions` is also accepted

**Bucket ACLs (REST JSON):**

- `ListBucketAcl` / `CreateBucketAcl`
- `GetBucketAcl` / `UpdateBucketAcl` / `DeleteBucketAcl`
- `ListDefaultObjectAcl` / `CreateDefaultObjectAcl`
- `GetDefaultObjectAcl` / `UpdateDefaultObjectAcl` / `DeleteDefaultObjectAcl`

**Project resources (REST JSON):**

- `GetServiceAccount` (`/storage/v1/projects/{project}/serviceAccount`), the principal
  Cloud Storage publishes as; grant it publish rights before wiring notifications
- `hmacKeys` create/list/get/update/delete (`/storage/v1/projects/{project}/hmacKeys`), the
  credentials S3-compatible clients present to GCS; the secret is returned once on create,
  and a key must be INACTIVE before it can be deleted

**Object operations (REST XML + REST JSON):**

- `PutObject` (simple and multipart/resumable upload)
- `GetObject`
- `DeleteObject`
- `ListObjects` (with `pageToken`, `prefix`, `delimiter` pagination, plus `startOffset`,
  `endOffset`, `matchGlob` and `includeTrailingDelimiter` filtering)
- Decompressive transcoding (an object stored with `contentEncoding: gzip` is served
  decompressed to a client that did not send `Accept-Encoding: gzip`, and as stored to one
  that did; `Range` is ignored on a transcoded read)
- `CopyObject`
- `MoveObject`
- `HeadObject`
- `PatchObject` (update metadata: `contentType`, `contentDisposition`, `contentEncoding`, `contentLanguage`, `cacheControl`, `customTime`, custom metadata)
- System metadata at upload time (`contentEncoding`, `contentDisposition`, `contentLanguage`,
  `cacheControl`, `customTime`, `storageClass`) in the JSON metadata part of a
  multipart/resumable upload; on the upload URL only `contentEncoding` is honoured, as on GCS
- `customTime` follows the GCS rules: rendered in UTC, never removed once set (a `null`
  patch or an unset gRPC `custom_time` under the mask is a no-op), and a decrease is
  rejected with `400` / `INVALID_ARGUMENT`
- `ComposeObject` (concatenate 1 to 32 source objects; 0 or more than 32 is a 400)
- `RewriteObject` (multi-call when the source and destination span storage classes or bucket
  locations: a `maxBytesRewrittenPerCall`, which must be a multiple of 1 MiB, below the object
  size returns `done: false` with a `rewriteToken` and the client loops until it completes; a
  same-class, same-location copy finishes in one call whatever limit is sent, as in GCS)
- `hmacKeys` are stored through the emulator's storage backend, so they survive restarts in
  persistent mode and are cleared by the reset endpoint
- Soft delete (`softDeletePolicy` on the bucket, `?softDeleted=true` listing, `objects.restore`)
- Pre-signed GET/PUT URLs (V4 signature via IAM `SignBlob`)
- Batch requests (`/batch/storage/v1`), including when the container's published port
  differs from its internal one (`docker run -p 9000:4588`)
- Customer-supplied encryption keys (CSEK)

Object names containing `/`, spaces, `+`, or percent-encoded sequences round-trip correctly, the emulator preserves URI-encoded names exactly as real GCS does.

**Pub/Sub notifications (REST JSON):**

- `CreateNotification` / `ListNotifications` / `GetNotification` / `DeleteNotification` (`/storage/v1/b/{bucket}/notificationConfigs`), object changes publish to the configured Pub/Sub topic in the local backend

**Object ACLs (REST JSON):**

- `ListObjectAcl` / `CreateObjectAcl`
- `GetObjectAcl` / `UpdateObjectAcl` / `DeleteObjectAcl`

**Conditional requests (preconditions):**

- `ifGenerationMatch` / `ifGenerationNotMatch`
- `ifMetagenerationMatch` / `ifMetagenerationNotMatch`
- `ifSourceGenerationMatch` / `ifSourceGenerationNotMatch` for object moves
- `ifSourceMetagenerationMatch` / `ifSourceMetagenerationNotMatch` for object moves
- Returns HTTP 412 on precondition failure
- Enforced atomically on object mutation paths under object locks, with a monotonic generation sequence, concurrent writers with `ifGenerationMatch=0` race safely (exactly one wins)

## XML multipart uploads

Native XML object routes support POST `?uploads`, PUT `?uploadId=...&partNumber=...`,
GET parts, POST completion and DELETE abort. Bucket GET `?uploads` lists pending
uploads with prefix and key/upload-ID markers. Parts and sessions use StorageFactory
and survive graceful restarts in persistent, hybrid and WAL modes. Incomplete
uploads do not appear in ordinary object inventory.

Part numbers range from 1 to 10000. Completion validates increasing order, ETags
and the 5 MiB minimum for every non-final part. Retrying a part replaces that part;
a failed completion preserves the session. Completed objects have CRC32C and an
opaque ETag, but no MD5 hash. Multipart upload delimiter grouping, customer-supplied
encryption, upload preconditions and lifecycle expiry of incomplete sessions are
unsupported. The emulator buffers parts and completed bytes in memory. Object
publication and session removal are separate checkpoints; crash-atomic completion
across those stores is not guaranteed.

Authentication retains the existing emulator credential acceptance and limited
CAB checks. Signed URL expiry checks do not prove cryptographic signature
enforcement. The SDK suite uses only synthetic credentials and fixture signing keys.

Multipart object metadata is finalized before storage publication and Pub/Sub or
Eventarc finalization events. The event and stored generation agree on the opaque
ETag, CRC32C, content metadata and absence of MD5. Ordinary uploads continue to
include their MD5. Object publication and multipart-session removal still use
separate checkpoints; crash-atomic multipart completion is not guaranteed.
